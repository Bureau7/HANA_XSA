# HANA_XSA

This repository is a POC style repo for HANA XSA developemnts.
The reason for POC is to show that NodeJS applications could work with HANA DB natively to pull and to push data.
POC Development started by the collective on 02.03.2018. 
The examples based on Brad Traversy's 12 NodeJS projects and adapted for SAP HANA.

1. SimpleServer is just a concept.
2. Express Website utilises - Pug (former Jade) is unavailable in SAP's NPM repository, so copied manually into the node_modules for express website project.
